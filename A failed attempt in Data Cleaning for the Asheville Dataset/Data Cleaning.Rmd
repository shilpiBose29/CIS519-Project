Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

TODO

- [ ] how is `host_listing_count` different from `host_total_listing_count`?
- [ ] Expand remaining string-typed columns into multiple columns of boolean features. Make sure the new column names stay consistent across datasets.
- [ ] let's forget about it.

Let's try the summarized CSV for listings:

```{r}

```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
