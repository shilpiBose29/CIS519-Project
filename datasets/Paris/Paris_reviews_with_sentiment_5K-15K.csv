Super advice as to where to go and what to do. The flat was so easy to get to and very easy to check in. It's location really is fantastic as it's well connected to loads of places in the city and also great to walk from if you wish. The flat had everything I needed to have a comfortable stay and a supermarket just outside the door meant that it was easy for me to buy goods and cook too. Thank you Adele! I look forward to my next stay in Paris. ,0.285138888889,0.506944444444

There were about 4-5 people with loud sewing machines and lots of constant chatter. I texted Simon to inquire about the hours of this business and he promptly informed me that they end at 7pm.

The appartment is very good value for its price. It is well equipped with fridge, oven/microwave, stove, dishwashing machine, expresso machine with capsules. Nicolas is an excellent and flexible host (e.g. he provided us with an extra mattress for the baby). Besides the small negative points that I mention below I recommend staying here. 

Cons: The mattress (the one on the bed, not the extra one) is worn down and not very comfortable. The ""pillows"" that we were given were hard cushions, not really pillows, and gave my wife a stiff neck the first night. I suspect the pillow/mattress combination could have reduced my overall experience on a longer stay.

- there were construction works with the building, so we didn't have access to the windows and balcony, but Katarina notified us and it's a temporary thing;

Nice and close to St. michel notre dame RER and metro.  You can hear a little noise from the streets on weekends but not enough to bother. The kitchen was awesome with the fridge big enough to store food bought from the loal Monoprix supermarket.  Overall made our stay in paris just that much better than our last few times.

The terrace is truly priceless in and of it self. I'm 23, and he allowed myself and 6 friends hang out on it while he was having dinner with a friend...talk about a great host.

A few critiques that future travelers should know:

1) The closest metro station is Chateau Rouge, which is in a bit of a sketchy area.  Also, the Metro line 4, which will be the main line you take if you stay here, can generally be sketchy.  
2) The smaller bedroom and the bathroom do not have closing doors, but rather a sliding door which provides visual privacy, but no sound privacy.

We spent three days in Paris at Zazie's. 
The room was comfortable and very clean and much more than that this house is a real ""parisienne"" experience.
Flowers as well as very nice forniture are all around. You can feel Zazie's taste in all the details of the room and of the house. 
Breakfast is served in the main house and is a very nice moment to talk and discuss with Zazie, if you want. 
The location of the house is perfect both for walking, for public transportation and to reach the most important sightseeing of Paris. Jardin de Luxembourg are near by so that you can easly run there or play tennis or spend some hours enjoying this wonderfull park in the center of Paris. The area is absolutely cosy and many nice restaurants are located around the appartment.

First the good stuff:
- The greeter is really lovely and makes you feel very welcome
- The location is simply superb, close to wonderful restaurants and the neighbourhood is great
- Jeanne is very responsive, the boiler broke while we were there and Jeanne arranged for a plumber the very same day
- The apartment is really cozy and comfortable.

Not so good stuff:
- The apartment wasn't clean, the floors were in pretty bad shape... soles of my feet were black after walking around
- The bath was blocked full of hair and also not clean
- It feels more like a hotel than an airbnb, doesn't feel like anybody really lives there and lots of rules on fines/late fees.
